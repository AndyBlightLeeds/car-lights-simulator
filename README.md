# Car Lights Simulator

Simulate controlling the lights on a car.

Written with help from [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai/).

The lights that can be controlled are:

* Headlights: dipped (dim white), full beam (bright white).
* Side Lights: (rear: left and right dim red, front: left and right dim white)
* Brake Lights: (rear: left and right bright red)
* Indicators: (all orange/amber), left, right , hazard.
* Reverse: (bright white on rear lamp clusters)
* Fog light: (bright red on rear lamp clusters)

The [design notes](design.md) go into more detail.

## Build and run

```bash
cd src
make
./car_lights_sim
```

NOTE: The test code built a while ago but after all the refactoring, it is now broken.  The `car_light_sim` tests most of the functions that matter although it is not automatic.

## Bugs

* None that I'm aware of.
